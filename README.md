# ToDo App

This is a Todo application built with React that integrates with an external API for managing todos. It allows users to add, delete, and mark todos as complete.

## Demo

Play the live version of the 2048 game [here](https://ekateriina7.github.io/react-todo-app-with-api/).

## Features

- Add new todos.
- Delete existing todos.
- Mark todos as complete or incomplete.
- Fetch todos from an external API.
- Persist todos using an API.

### State management
This app uses React Context in combination with useReducer to manage global state in a manner similar to Redux. This allows for predictable state transitions and cleaner code without needing the full Redux setup.
